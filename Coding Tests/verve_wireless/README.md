//
// FrontEnd Code Challenge
//


// Overview

This test is provided as an opportunity to demonstrate your JavaScript engineering knowledge, as well as CSS and DOM manipulation.  The logic and approach you take are more important than the actual finished product.  We're more interested in your methodology and ability to think outside the box.


// Instructions

Using HTML, CSS and native JavaScript (no third party libraries such as jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.) use image assets and JSON response from the URL below to build a full page mobile ad. Your ad will need to request the JSON data from this endpoint and display it however you deem appropriate. There is a mockup in this folder to help you get an idea of what the end product might look like.

JSON: http://cls.vrvm.com/pois?id=5541&limit=10&latitude=37.7324&longitude=-121.8916

The ad must demonstrate the following on a mobile device (320x480 / Portrait):

  - Google Map w/ plotted pins from the first (2) locations in the JSON.
  - Using those same (2) locations, display them below the map as text, aligned with the "Get Directions" buttons.
      - Address
      - City, State Zip
  - Create actions for the "Get Directions" buttons that will redirect the user to each respective location via Google Maps.

Your finished product must include separate, external files for your JavaScript and CSS.


// Bonus

  - Do something creative with CSS animations and/or transitions.
  - Do something cool in the console.
  - Get the user's current location and do something with it.
  - Youâ€™re working with limited assets here - how can you make this as responsive as you can? What can you do to improve the experience for larger screens such as the iPhone 6 plus?
